1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

   - `describe()` groups together a block of several tests belonging to the same function and defines what the tests are for while `it()` sort of defines what each individual test within the `describe()` block does and runs the test.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

   - The point of TDD is to minimize risk of regressions on products sent out to clients or customers by running tests on the application before writing and executing the code which then passes the test(s) before production. It adds to the workload by implimenting more steps in the creation of an application but then it is benefitial on the long run as built applications have less bugs.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

   - Unit testing,
   - Integration testing, and
   - Component testing
